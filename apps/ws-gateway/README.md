# ðŸ§­ WebSocket Gateway Service â€” Architecture & Contribution Guide

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **WebSocket Gateway** serves as the real-time entry point for all client communications. It maintains persistent WebSocket connections with clients and acts as a central relay, routing messages to various backend microservices such as:

- **Location Service**
- **Chat Service**
- **Notification Service**

    Gateway -->|gRPC| NotificationService



Clients establish persistent WebSocket connections to the Gateway.

The Gateway decodes messages and forwards them to appropriate backend services via gRPC.

Backend responses are sent back to clients over the same WebSocket connection.

Components:
Connection Map: Maintains a map of active WebSocket connections for broadcasting and managing lifecycle events.

Read Pump: Reads and decodes incoming WebSocket messages using a goroutine.

Write Pump: Sends outgoing messages from the backend to clients over WebSocket.

Message Channel: A per-connection buffered channel ensuring non-blocking writes.

gRPC Clients: Enables communication with microservices using strongly typed Protobuf contracts.
